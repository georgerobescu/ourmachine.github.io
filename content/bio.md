I'm Kei Kreutler. My work spans disciplines and includes thinking about organizational practice, utopian conspiracies, and new cosmograms as theories of political change and ecological resilience. I've worked on decentralized co-operatives, augmented reality games, and software for open source space observation. Read some of my published writing [here](https://technosphere-magazine.hkw.de/p/The-Byzantine-Generalization-Problem-Subtle-Strategy-in-the-Context-of-Blockchain-Governance-8UNNcM8VShTpBGWRuob1GP), and see work I've exhibited [here](https://kei.bio).

I'm currently Strategy Director at [Gnosis](https://gnosis.io). You can send me an email [here](mailto:kei+blog@ourmachine.net).
