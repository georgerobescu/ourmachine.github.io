<br><br>

Skipping two stones that hit,  
waiting, filing my nails.

Hung words to dry  
over the same long lakeshore,  
I rock it out of them.    
_Someday_, my aunt says,

_someday_, she always had  
a thing for adverbs,  
_this place'll be zapped, evap-ed,  
flat like a bug._

Her dog chases my stones.  
He waddles, uninterested,  
missing one leg,  
he lost in the war,

but still smiles like tin.  
I return to the emery board.  
while true == 0:  
Keep cycling 

while I sit, wondering  
at the raw iron smell   
seeping from the gut  
of a simple pond.

He sniffs at my arm.  
_An infinite loop  
is actually very small_,  
I tell my aunt.

She doesn't ask  
where it goes,  
but beats at the line,  
_Still wet. Soon, soon!_
